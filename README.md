 # Dragon Game

## Overview
This is a simple **Dragon Game** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The player controls a character (or dragon) that avoids obstacles. The game features movement, collision detection, and basic scoring â€” great for learning core JavaScript concepts.

## Features
- Player-controlled dragon or character
- Moving obstacles to avoid
- Collision detection system
- Live score tracking
- Sound effects and animations (if included)
- Game over and restart functionality

## How It Works
- The character moves using key events (e.g., up arrow or spacebar)
- Obstacles move continuously across the screen using CSS animations or JavaScript
- Collision is detected by comparing character and obstacle positions
- Score increases over time or with distance
- When collision is detected, the game stops and a Game Over message is displayed

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: To create the basic layout and elements  
- **CSS**: For styling, background, and animations  
- **JavaScript**: For game logic, movement, scoring, and collision detection
